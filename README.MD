# Css - Integration

### A first evaluation-esque solo exercise to measure our thusfar aquired webdev skills.

This challenge requires us to rebuild two interface as pixelperfect as we can, using our current skill in webdevelopment.

Using other sources than the good-ol' internet and our own experience is not allowed. This partly to mimic a work environment
 where there aren't 20 other motivated colleagues ready to help you all the time.

***

## Any regulations?

* Any technique learned is allowed to be used (nothing is off limits, except copy-pasting code)
* Try to use best practise techniques for Git & git commits
* Proper research for techniques you try to use
* Provide a professional and helpful/informative README.md

## What about our code?

* Make sure your code is valid: check with online validators
* This does not exclude your css: check with online validators
* Make sure your finished product is viewable by anyone (at least within this course)
* When finished, set up two seperate links within this README.md to the respective interaces.
